#### Create a table summary of a GitHub account's repo statistics.


## Background

I often miss 'issues' as they are posted.  
This script provides a concise overview of my repos, sorting by 'issues' in the first table column.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository or extract the file archive into a suitable directory in the server's web directory.
2. On *nix servers, set appropriate file ownership on this directory.
3. Edit */config.php*: change `<username>` in line 9 to a real GitHub account name.
4. View */index.php* in a browser.
